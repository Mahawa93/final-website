    <h1>Eddie Kendricks</h1>
    <p>Edward James Kendrick (December 17, 1939 â€“ October 5, 1992), best known by the stage name Eddie Kendricks, was an American singer and songwriter. Noted for his distinctive falsetto singing style, Kendricks co-founded the Motown singing group The Temptations, and was one of their lead singers from 1960 until 1971. His was the lead voice on such famous songs as &quot;The Way You Do The Things You Do&quot;, &quot;Get Ready&quot;, and &quot;Just My Imagination&quot;. As a solo artist, Kendricks recorded several hits of his own during the 1970s, including the number-one single &quot;Keep On Truckin'&quot;.</p>
    <h1>Early years</h1>
    <p><br />
      Kendricks was born in Union Springs, Alabama on December 17, 1939, the son of Johnny and Lee Bell Kendrick. He had one sister, Patricia, and three brothers, Charles, Robert, and Clarence. His family moved to Birmingham, where he met and began singing with his best friend Paul Williams in their church choir in the late 1940s. In 1955, Kendricks, Williams, and friends Kell Osborne and Jerome Averette formed a doo-wop group called The Cavaliers, and began performing around Birmingham. The group decided to move for better opportunities in their musical careers, and in 1957 the group moved to Cleveland, Ohio. In Cleveland, they met manager Milton Jenkins, and soon moved with Jenkins to Detroit, Michigan, where the Cavaliers renamed themselves 'The Primes'. Under Jenkins' management, the Primes did well for themselves in the Detroit area, eventually creating a female spin-off group called The Primettes (later The Supremes). In 1961, Osbourne moved to California, and the Primes disbanded. Kendricks and Paul Williams joined forces with members Otis Williams and Melvin &quot;Blue&quot; Franklin of Otis Wiliiams and the Distants after three members quit and became The Elgins, who on the same day changed their name to &quot;The Temptations&quot; and signed to Motown.</p>
