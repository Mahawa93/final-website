    <h1>Exit David Ruffin, enter Dennis Edwards<br/>
    </h1>
    <p>From early 1964 to mid 1968, the Temptations went from unknown hopefuls to international stars and as a result, appeared frequently on television shows such as American Bandstand, The Ed Sullivan Show, and The Hollywood Palace. At the same time, the group began to achieve a crossover success, catering to middle America with a pop standards album (The Temptations in a Mellow Mood, 1967), the success of which resulted in performances at the famous Copacabana in New York City along with dates at other similar supper clubs. Outside of music, the Temptations were made honorary members of Phi Beta Sigma fraternity.</p><br/>
      <p>By 1967, David Ruffin had begun demanding special treatment as lead singer, riding to and from gigs in a private mink-lined limousine with his then-girlfriend, Motown singer Tammi Terrell, instead of in the group limousine used by the other four Temptations. The other members slowly became irritated and annoyed with Ruffin's behavior. Following Motown's decision to rechristen The Supremes as Diana Ross &amp; the Supremes, Ruffin felt entitled to the same treatment and demanded that his group be renamed as well, to David Ruffin &amp; the Temptations. Ruffin was also causing friction with Berry Gordy by demanding an accounting of the group's earnings.<br/></p>

      <p>Some of this behavior was attributed to the fact that by this time Ruffin had begun using cocaine regularly, building further tension within the group and causing him to miss a number of group meetings, rehearsals, and concerts. There was a general consensus among the rest of the group that Ruffin needed to be replaced. Otis Williams insists that Ruffin was given ample and fair warning that if he did not change his attitude he would be fired. However, when Ruffin missed a June 1968 engagement at a Cleveland supper club in order to attend a show by his new girlfriend Barbara Gail Martin (daughter of Dean Martin),it was decided that he had crossed the line. The other four Temptations drew up legal documentation, officially firing Ruffin from the group. Dennis Edwards, formerly of the Contours, was hired to replace him. Edwards and Ruffin were good friends, and at first, Ruffin went along with the changing of the guard and encouraged Edwards. After a short time, however, Ruffin began turning up at shows, jumping onstage during performances of the songs he once sang lead on, stealing the spotlight from Edwards.</p><br/>
      <p>In an interview with Tom Meros in 2011, Edwards said that audiences went crazy when David would come on stage to sing his original leads. Ruffin claimed he had turned over a new leaf and promised to conduct himself professionally if allowed back in the group. Otis, Melvin, Eddie, and Paul felt that David had earned a second chance and decided to let him rejoin. Edwards, having already been in the rotation for several months, was told that they were putting Ruffin back in the group though they were pleased with Dennis's performances. Plans were made to part ways with Edwards and it appeared that the &quot;Classic Five&quot; would be restored. Ruffin was supposedly on board and scheduled to perform with the group at its next show. However, he didn't arrive until the middle of the concert and that final misstep sealed his fate. Ruffin was officially let go from the group and Edwards was brought back in for good.<br/></p>
            <p>After the ordeal, Ruffin still attempted to interrupt concerts. Both the Temptations and Motown were forced to hire extra security guards to prevent Ruffin from attending other Temptations performances and providing further embarrassment to Edwards and the group. Ruffin then sued Motown in October 1968, seeking a release from the label, but Motown countersued to keep the singer from leaving and the case was eventually settled out of court. The settlement required Ruffin to remain with Motown as a solo artist to finish out his initial contract.<br /></p>
    <p>Edwards' first album with the Temptations was Live at the Copa, recorded at the group's return to the famous Copacabana nightclub, and later that year, Berry Gordy commissioned the first of a number of collaborations for the Temptations with Diana Ross &amp; the Supremes. The results included two studio albums, Together and Diana Ross &amp; the Supremes Join the Temptations, which featured the number-two hit single &quot;I'm Gonna Make You Love Me&quot;. The tracks for the latter included Dennis Edwards' first studio recordings with the Temptations and further results of this collaboration included a joint tour and two NBC television specials, TCB (aired December 9, 1968) and G.I.T. on Broadway (aired November 12, 1969).</p>
